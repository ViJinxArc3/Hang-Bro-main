Rules of the game:


 Hang-bro is a word-re-generating game where a random word is generated and 

    the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The rules are as follows:

 1. One random word is being generated and pulled from a dictionary

 2. The other player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters 
     one at a time.

 3. If the guessed letter is in the word, the letter will be presented
     in the lower bar and no part of the hangman figure is drawn

 4. If the guessed letter is not in the word, it will be marked
     as a wrong letter and a part of the hangman figure will be drawn
    the hangman figure. The number of wrong guesses are: 6

 5. The game continues until the guessing player either correctly 
    guesses the word or completes the hangman figure, in which case 
    they lose the game.
